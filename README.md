# Blink Eyes

A game inspired on the App Store's game: Rainbrow and built following the [Brian Advent's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuvfNhKFnag&list=PLY1P2_piiWEYjjumZztc_U4EYTpwx9mfe).  

## Project

In this game, the player will move the emoji blinking his eyes, where this action is catching by camera with the AR feature. 
This game was built with ARKit and SpriteKit. It's my first experience with the Swift's Framework ARKit (an Augmented Reality framework). 


## How to Play

Download the project and open it using Xcode. Then, press the play button on the top left! üëæ
(It's necessary an iPhone X or newer and use the camera!)

Blink your eyes and have fun! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
